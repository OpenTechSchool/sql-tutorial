<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Aim of the course</h2>
<p>After the completion of this course, you will be able to use an SQL client to obtain data stored in an SQL database such as MySQL, MS-SQL, or Oracle DB. You will learn how to write queries which give you exactly the information you require and to   bring them into the form most suitable to answer the given questions.</p>

<h2>SQL databases</h2>
<p>SQL, being an acronym for <em>Structured Query Language</em>, does not denote a data base system but merely a <em>database language</em> used to access databases. However, we speak of <em>SQL databases</em> when we mean a database system which provides an SQL interface. Such databases are called relational databases as the data is stored in a set of table between which relationships exist (the primary-key / foreign-key relation described below).</p>

<h2>Software used</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we work with the file-based database system sqlite and the corresponding client sqlitebrowser. <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> is simple and quite powerful and allows to store a database in an single file. Besides many other applications it is also used in the android operating system to store application data on phones and tablets. How to install the require software on Linux, MacOS, and Windows is detailed in the provided <a href="installationguide.html">installation guide</a>.

<p>To perform a SQL query to a database, enter the command in the text field <em>SQL string</em> and click on „Execute Command“. As an alternative to Sqlitebrowser you can use Sqliteman which is a good alternative especially for Debian and Ubuntu Linux users. Please refer to the installation guide for details.</p>

<h2>Sample database</h2>
<p>As the focus of this tutorial lies on the retrieval of data from an existing database rather than creating new databases, a file <a href="databaseOTS.sqlite">databaseOTS.sqlite</a> is provided which contains all the data required later on in the course.</p>

<h2>General hints</h2>
<p>Write all sql-Statements in an text editor first. This way it is much easier to reuse statements formulated before. All text in <code>fixed font</code> is code (usually SQL statements). Note that SQL key words such as <code>select</code> or <code>from</code> are not case sensitive. Questions or Excercises are written as:</p>
<p class=question>Have you sucesfully installed SQLite?</p>
<p>The answer to the questions (or a SQL statement which yields the answer) are found <a href="solutions.html">here</a>. You are <strong>strongly</strong> encouraged not only to answer the questions but also to try out all presented commands with some examples of you own.</p>

<p>So, now you can get started to lean the <a href="chapter2.html">SQL basics</a>.
