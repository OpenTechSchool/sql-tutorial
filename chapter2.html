<h1>SQL basics</h1>

<h2>Simple queries</h2>
<p>In a SQL database, data is stored in a set of tables. A table contains a collection of entries (="lines"), information of the same type such as personal data or phone contract information.</p> 

<p align=center><img src="table1.png" alt="person table" width=650></p>
<p align=center><img src="table2.png" alt="phone_contract table" width=650></p>


<p>We want to see what is in the table person:</p>
<pre>select * from person;</pre>
<p>This is too much information as we are only interested in the name:</p>
<pre>select name from person;</pre>
<p>In general:</p>
<pre>select col1, col2, ... from tablename;</pre>
<p>We can get the number of lines of results by using the count command. To get the number of entries in the person table we use</p>
<pre>select count(*) from person;</pre>
<p>Results might contain duplicates (they form a multi-set). We can get only the distinct results by</p>
<pre>select distinct col1,col2, ... from tablename;</pre>
<p>Now you have learned enough start writing SQL queries and to answer the first question
<p class=question>1.) Return a list of residences without duplicates.</p>
<p class=question>2.) How many different cities of residence do the people in the persons table have?</p>

<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p>Quite often we are not interested in all of the entries of the database, especially because it might contain a huge number of lines. To get only the lines fulfilling some constraints, the <code>where</code> clause is used, e.g:</p>
<pre>select name, residence from person where age > 30;</pre>
<p>For the different type of data, different constrains make sense. For all kind of data, we can check for equal <code>=</code> and not equal <code>!=</code>. For numbers, one can also compare for <em>larger</em> <code>></code>, <em>larger or equal</em> <code>>=</code>, <em>smaller</em> <code><</code>, <em>smaller or equal</em> <code><=</code>.</p>

<p>For text, we use <code>like</code>, to find entries where the text value in a column contains a string. The string should be surrounded by single quotes <code>'</code>, and you can use the <code>%</code> as a wild-card for unknown parts of a word. E.g. if you search for <code>'%an%'</code>, the following words would fit: B<strong>an</strong>ana, f<strong>an</strong>tasy, but not <strong>An</strong>na, since this is a Capital A.</p>
<p class=question>3.) Get all people whose names contains "oh".</p>
<p>In SQLite the <code>></code>,<code><</code>,<code>=</code> operators for dates, do an <em>lexicographical</em> comparison, not a <em>numeric</em> one. This means that if there is an inconsistent representation of dates, the comparison might fail even though the two values represent the same dates. E.g. if once the format <code>"2014-10-23"</code> and once the format <code>"2014/10/16"</code> is used. Note that here double quotes <code>"</code> are used instead of single quotes <code>'</code>.</p>
There is a table named <code>flight</code> containg flight data. The column with the dates is called <code>date</code>.
<p class=question>4.) Get all flights before October 20.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the operator <code>in</code> checks if the left-hand-side is a member of the set on the right-hand-side. The two following statements are equivalent</p>
<pre>
name in ('Philipp', 'Carlos') 
</pre><pre>
name = 'Philipp' or name = 'Carlos' 
</pre>
<p class=question>5.)Formulate two suitable queries to demonstrate that.</p>

<p>Constraints can be combined by the logical operator <code>and</code> and the operator <code>or</code>.</p>
<p class=question>6.) Find all people whose first name is Carlos and who are older than 20 years.</p>
<p>There is another table which is called <code>phone_contract</code>. The column containing the status (active, non-active) is called <code>status</code>.</p>
<p class=question>7.) Find out, how many contracts there are and how many accounts are active.</p>

<h2>Results from more than one table</h2>
<p>Usually, it is necessary to get information which is spread over more than one table. For example, you may want to know the names of the people who have an active phone contract.</p>
<p>When you know what you are looking for you are already able to formulate a concrete condition in the where clause. With SQL you can combine information from various tables, e.g.</p>
<pre>select person.name, phone_contract.phone_number 
from person, phone_contract;
</pre>
<p>Note that we could also write <code>phone_number</code> instead of <code>phone_contract.phone_number</code> as the table person does not contain a column called <code>phone_number</code> and, therefore, no ambiguity could arise.</p>
<p class=question>8.) What does this query return?</p>
<p>To output the matching names and phone numbers, we can use a <code>where</code> clause again:</p>
<pre>select p.name, phone_number from person p, phone_contract c
where c.name = p.name;</pre>
<p>As we did not want to write the complete table name, we have defined and abbreviation in the <code>from</code> clause (<code>person p</code>).</p>
<p class=question>9.) Find all names who have an active phone contract.</p>
<p class=question>10.) Find all names and phone numbers of people who are older than 30.</p>

<h2>Sub-queries</h2>
<p>The methods described above allow to get information from an arbitrary number of tables. But if you want to formulate a condition which depends on values of certain data entries, you need sub-queries. </p>

<p class=question>11.)What does the following query do?</p>
<pre>
select person.name, person.age, phone_number from person, phone_contract
where person.name = phone_contract.name and
age in (select age from person where residence = 'Paris');
</pre>
<p>The part in the last line in parentheses is called a <em>sub-query</em>. Such sub-queries can be a little bit confusing at first sight so you might want to pause for a moment.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the statement above a little bit closer. First, only perform the sub-query. It returns a the <em>list</em> of all ages of persons with residence in Paris. Then then <em>in</em> operator is used to filter the results of the main query on ages occuring in this list.</p>
