<h1>Installation Guide</h1>

<p>This guide helps you to set up the software you need for the OTS course "Working with SQL databases". As a database system we use <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> which has the advantage that it is very easy to install and that a database is simply stored in a single file.</p>

<p><em>SQLite</em> comes with a console based application where you can perform queries as well as enter and edit data. You can work through the complete tutorial just using this console application. However, for better usability you can also use a front end with a graphical user interface. We especially recommend <a href="http://www.sqlitebrowser.org">DB Browser for SQLite</a> and <a href="http://www.sqliteman.yarpen.cz">Sqliteman</a>.</p>

<p>Below you find installation instructions for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.</p>

<h2>Microsoft Windows</h2>

<p>To get <em>SQLite</em>, download <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/2014/sqlite-shell-win32-x86-3080701.zip">a zip archive</a> from the <em>SQLite</em> project web page. This zip-archive contains an executable file <em>sqlite3.exe</em>. Copy this file to some place on your computer (the desktop should be fine). Double-click on it to start the program.</p>

<p>To get the graphical user interface <em>DB Browser for SQLite</em>, formerly called <em>Sqlitebrowser</em>, just download the <a href="https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/download/v3.4.0/sqlitebrowser-3.4.0-win32.exe">executable installer file</a>. Double-click in it to run it and agree to the license to finish the installation.</p> 

<h2>MacOS</h2>
<p>To get <em>SQLite</em>, download <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/2014/sqlite-shell-osx-x86-3080701.zip">a zip archive</a> from the <em>Sqlite</em> project web page. This zip-archive contains an executable file <em>sqlite3</em>. Copy this file to some place on your computer (the desktop should be fine). Right click on the file and select <em>open</em> and confirm the security message.</p>

<p>To get the graphical user interface <em>DB Browser for SQLite</em>, formerly called <em>Sqlitebrowser</em>, just download the <a href="https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/download/v3.4.0/sqlitebrowser-3.4.0.dmg">MacOS drive image</a>. Open it and copy the contained file to some location on your computer. Right click on the file and select <em>open</em> and confirm the security message.</p>
<h2>Linux</h2> 

<p>Binary packages for <em>SQLite</em> are availabe in the repositories for many linux distributions. For Debian/Ubuntu based distributions it can be installed by the following command:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install sqlite3
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, a zip-file containing a pre-compiled binary can be downloaded <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/2014/sqlite-shell-linux-x86-3080701.zip">here</a>. So there should be no need for building <em>SQLite</em> from source.<p>

<p>Unfortunately, the available binaries for <em>DB Browser for SQLite</em> (the package is called <em>sqlitebrowser</em>) are a quite outdated and a bit buggy. So we strongly recommend using <em>Sqliteman</em> instead. Under Debian/Ubuntu you can install the package <em>sqliteman</em> easily via <em>apt-get</em>. Alternatively, you can download the up-to-date source code for <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/download.html">DB Browser for SQLite</a> and build the software yourselves. If you really want to do this, you need the packages <em>libsqlite3-0</em>, <em>libsqlite3-dev</em>, <em>cmake</em> and7 <em>qt-sdk</em>. Note that the latter is the full QT software development kit which is roughly 250MB download.</p>
